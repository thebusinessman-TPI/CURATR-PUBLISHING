## 🎯 Daily Posting Strategy

### Recommended Schedule
- **Instagram:** 2-3 posts per day (9am, 2pm, 7pm)
- **TikTok:** 3-5 posts per day (spread throughout day)
- **YouTube Shorts:** 1-2 posts per day (morning and evening)

### Content Selection
1. Use **Brand Filter** to focus on specific brands
2. Use **Search** to find specific products or themes
3. Mix different outfit types (single, paired, trifecta, quartet, etc.)
4. Track what performs well and post more of that

### Time Management
- **5 minutes per post** (all 3 platforms)
- **15 minutes total** for 1 collection across all platforms
- **1 hour** = 4 collections = 12 posts total

---

## 📊 Tracking Your Progress

### Stats Dashboard
The tool shows:
- **Total Collections** - How many match your current filters
- **Posted** - How many you've marked as posted
- **Pending** - How many are left to post

### Filters
- **All Brands** - See everything
- **Specific Brand** - Focus on one brand (e.g., "AshworthGolf")
- **Posted/Pending** - See what's done vs. what's left

### Search
Type anything to find:
- Brand names
- Product types
- Keywords in hooks or captions

---

## 🔄 Syncing Between NUC1 and NUC2

Your posted status is saved in **browser localStorage**, which means:
- ✅ Status persists when you refresh the page
- ✅ Status stays on the same computer
- ❌ Status does NOT sync between NUC1 and NUC2

**Workaround:** Pick one computer for tracking, or manually mark on both.

**Future:** We'll add cloud-based status tracking so it syncs everywhere.

### YouTube Example
```
Classic edge, built for heat & hustle

The belt's textured finish grounds the elevated utility of the Ashworth Tech Vest—precise but relaxed. Anchor it with Puma's AP Classic G shoes for a lightweight boost that translates from fairway to city streets. Clean lines. Heat-ready. Always in play.
